# Blockchain
I have implemented the Blockchain as a double-linked list. This enables me
to reference the previous and next nodes.

## Time Analysis
Adding items to the Blockchain takes O(1) time.

## Space Analysis
If we have **n** Blockchain nodes then we will need a double-linked list
of O(n) size.

Total space: O(n)
